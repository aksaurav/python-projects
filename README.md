# Restaurant Recommendation System

This Python project implements a basic restaurant recommendation system based on user preferences and restaurant ratings.

## Overview

The project allows users to input their preferred cuisines, and based on that input, it generates a list of recommended restaurants that match the user's preferences and meet a specified minimum rating threshold.

## Features

- Accepts user input for preferred cuisines.
- Filters restaurants based on user preferences and minimum ratings.
- Provides a list of recommended restaurants that match the criteria.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
4. Run the Python script using `python filename.py`.
5. Enter your preferred cuisines as prompted.
6. View the list of recommended restaurants.

## File Structure

- `restaurant_recommendation.py`: Contains the main Python script implementing the recommendation system.
- `note.md`: Additional notes and project documentation.
- `test_recommendation.py`: Unit tests for the recommendation function.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Test Cases

- Test cases have been implemented using `unittest` to validate different scenarios.
- Tests cover scenarios such as valid user preferences, no recommendations, invalid user input, and empty user input.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with external APIs for enhanced restaurant data.
- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
- Consideration for scalability with larger restaurant datasets.
